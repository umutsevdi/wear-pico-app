## Project Definition

Wearable technologies are becoming increasingly important in today’s world. Among
them, smartwatches are the most widely accepted technology among consumers.

Within the scope of the project, I developed a smartwatch and an associated
Android application that communicates with it. The smartwatch is designed as an
embedded system without a full-fledged operating system. In addition to basic clock
functions such as time, alarm, and stopwatch, the smartwatch will have features such
as receiving notifications, handling calls, and controlling the media player on the
phone. The touchscreen-operated watch will also include an accelerometer, a buzzer
for alarm sounds, and a motor for vibration.

On the mobile side, there is a mobile application that can respond to requests and
messages sent by the smartwatch via Bluetooth. The application allows users to set
alarms on the smartwatch and will manage background services such as notifications,
calls, and media controls using Android services.
